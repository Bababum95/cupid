Consequently, you have to ensure that the e-mail address that you have deposited with us is the correct one, and that the receipt of the respective e-mails is guaranteed. In particular, you have to ensure that the respective e-mails are not blocked by a SPAM filter.</p><strong>§ 3 Contract duration / Cancellation in case of subscription contracts</strong><p>(1) The subscription contract concluded between you and us has an indefinite term. The contract can be terminated by both parties with a notice period of 1 month to the end of the month (unless otherwise stipulated in the respective offer).</p><p>(2) The right to terminate the contract without notice for important reasons remains unaffected.</p><p>(3) Any notice of termination must be declared and transmitted either in text form (e.g. e-mail) or via the cancellation button integrated on our Internet presence (\"Cancel contracts here\" or similar designation).</p><strong>§ 4 Special agreements related to the offered payment methods</strong><p>(1) Payment via \"Stripe\"</p><p>If you select a payment method offered via \"Stripe\", the payment will be processed via the payment service provider Stripe Payments Europe Limited (1 Grand Canal Street Lower, Grand Canal Dock, Dublin, D02 H210, Ireland; \"Stripe\").

Even if you do not comply with this request, it shall have no effect on your legal warranty claims.</p><p>(3) If a characteristic of the goods deviates from the objective requirements, the deviation shall only be deemed to be agreed if you were informed of the same by us before submitting the contractual declaration and the deviation was expressly and separately agreed between the contracting parties.</p><strong>§ 7 Redeeming Promotional Vouchers</strong><p>(1) Vouchers issued free of charge as part of promotional campaigns, with a specific validity period, and which cannot be purchased by customers (hereinafter \"promotional vouchers\"), can only be redeemed in our online shop at www.cupidchoco.com and only during the specified period.</p><p>(2) Promotional vouchers can only be redeemed by consumers.</p><p>(3) Certain products may be excluded from the voucher campaign if the corresponding restriction results from the content of the promotional voucher.</p><p>(4) Promotional vouchers must be redeemed before completing the order process.

We can make payment with discharging effect to the respective holder who redeems the promotional voucher in our online shop. This does not apply if we have kn</p><p>owledge or grossly negligent ignorance of the ineligibility, legal incapacity, or lack of representation of the respective holder.</p><strong>§ 8 Warranty</strong><p>(1) Statutory defect liability rights apply.</p><p>(2) As a consumer, you are requested to check the goods immediately upon delivery for completeness, obvious defects, and transport damage, and to notify us and the carrier of any complaints as soon as possible. Failure to do so has no effect on your statutory warranty claims.</p><p>(3) If a feature of the goods deviates from the objective requirements, the deviation shall only be deemed agreed if you were informed by us of the deviation before submitting your contractual declaration and the deviation was expressly and separately agreed between the contracting parties.</p><p>(4) If the customer is an entrepreneur, the limitation period for defect claims is one year from the transfer of risk. The statutory limitation periods for recourse claims according to § 445b BGB remain unaffected. The liability limitations do not apply to damages resulting from injury to life, body, or health or from intentional or grossly negligent breaches of duty on our part or our vicarious agents.</p><strong>§ 9 Choice of law, place of fulfilment, jurisdiction</strong><p>(1) German law shall apply. This choice of law only applies to customers if it does not result in the revocation of the protection guaranteed by the mandatory provisions of the law of the country in which the respective customer’s usual place of residence is located (benefit-of-the-doubt principle).</p><p>(2) If you are not a consumer, but a businessman, a legal entity under public law or an institutional fund governed by public law, our place of business is the place of jurisdiction as well as the place of fulfilment for all services that follow from the business relationships that exist with us. The same condition applies to situations in which you are not associated with a general place of jurisdiction in Germany or the EU, as well as situations in which the place of residence or the usual place of residence is not known at the time of commencement of proceedings. This has no bearing on the capacity to call upon the court associated with another place of jurisdiction.</p><p>(3) The provisions of the UN Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods are explicitly inapplicable.</p>",

Use aroma and massage candles: Light high-quality scented candles with aphrodisiac aromas to create the right atmosphere and generate a sensual mood. Aromas help relax and enjoy the moment more intensely. Massage candles can also be used to perform a relaxing massage – the perfect start to intimate time together.\n\n3. Soft lighting and music: Create a moodful environment with dimmed lights and one of Cupid’s romantic Spotify playlists. Gentle lighting and matching music contribute to lifting the mood and stimulating the senses.\n\n4. Use Cupid’s blindfold: Use the blindfold from Cupid, which you can either buy on our website or receive for free, to temporarily block one of the senses. This intensifies the perception of the other senses and increases tension. The partner with the blindfold feels touches more intensely and is focused solely on the current sensations.\n\n5. Use Cupid’s erotic dice: The dice with erotic tasks developed by our team bring a playful element into lovemaking. The dice contain simple but effective tasks such as 'Kiss,' 'Lick,' 'Hug,' or 'Stroke.' These tasks are specifically designed to break down inhibitions, add fun to the moment, and encourage spontaneity. They allow partners to create closeness in a playful way and make the lovemaking more exciting. They help discover new, exciting ways to ignite passion.\n\n6. The 'Heartfelt Naked' card game by our partners: The 'Heartfelt Naked' card game offers questions and tasks designed to create a deeper connection between partners. It encourages open conversations about desires and needs, helping partners get closer not only physically but also emotionally. This connection is a central component to fully enjoying the effect of the chocolate.\n\n7. Take time for aftercare: After the intimate adventure, take time to cuddle and share the moments enjoyed together. This aftercare is an important part of the experience, as it builds trust and deepens the emotional connection between partners.\n\nBy combining Cupid Sex Chocolate with these sensual accessories and games, the experience is intensified for both partners. The combination of taste, aroma, and touch experiences creates an atmosphere where closeness, trust, and passion are naturally promoted."

partners. </li> </ul> <h4>Serotonin Boost</h4> <ul> <li> <strong>Relaxation and Well-being: </strong> Dark chocolate increases serotonin levels in the brain, promoting relaxation and reducing stress.

Properties</h4> <ul> <li> <strong>Flavonoids: </strong> Rich in antioxidants, dark chocolate supports cardiovascular health by improving blood flow and lowering blood pressure. </li> <li>

amino acid that converts into nitric oxide, a molecule that relaxes blood vessels and improves circulation. </li> <li> <strong>Enhanced Sensations: </strong> Better blood flow to erogenous zones can increase sensitivity and arousal. </li> </ul> <h4>Supporting Sexual Function</h4> <ul> <li> <strong>Erectile Function: </strong> In men, improved blood flow can positively affect erectile quality and

        "content": "<h3>Evaluating the Evidence for Aphrodisiac Ingredients</h3> <p> The effectiveness of aphrodisiac foods has been a subject of scientific inquiry, aiming to separate myth from reality. Let's delve into the research behind the key ingredients found in Cupid Aphrodisiac Chocolate. </p> <h4>Dark Chocolate: The Heart-Healthy Indulgence</h4> <h5>Flavonoids and Cardiovascular Health</h5> <ul> <li> <strong>Improved Blood Flow: </strong> Dark chocolate is rich in flavonoids, particularly flavanols, which have antioxidant properties. These compounds promote the production of nitric oxide in the body, leading to vasodilation and improved blood circulation. </li> <li> <strong>Research Findings: </strong> A study published in the Journal of Sexual Medicine found that improved endothelial function from flavonoid-rich foods like dark chocolate may enhance sexual function due to better blood flow. </li> </ul> <h5>Mood Enhancement through Phenylethylamine</h5> <ul> <p> <strong>\"Love Chemical\" Effects:</strong> Phenylethylamine (PEA) in chocolate is known to release endorphins, creating feelings of happiness and attraction. </p> <p> <strong>Neurotransmitter Influence: </strong> PEA may increase dopamine levels in the brain, associated with pleasure and reward pathways, potentially enhancing mood and desire. </p> </ul> <h4>Black Maca Extract: Nature's Libido Enhancer</h4> <h5>Clinical Trials on Sexual Desire</h5> <ul> <li> <strong>Male Sexual Health: </strong> A randomized controlled trial in Andrologia demonstrated that men consuming 1.5 to 3 grams of maca per day reported increased sexual desire over 12 weeks compared to a placebo group. </li> <li> <strong>Female Sexual Function: </strong> A study in Menopause journal found that maca improved sexual dysfunction in postmenopausal women, suggesting hormone-balancing effects. </li> </ul> <h5>Hormonal Balance and Energy</h5> <ul> <li> <strong>Endocrine Support: </strong> Maca may help regulate levels of cortisol and other hormones, contributing to reduced stress and enhanced libido. </li> <li> <strong>Energy Levels: </strong> Its nutrient-rich profile supports overall vitality, which is essential for sexual health. </li> </ul> <h4>L-Arginine: Boosting Blood Flow and Libido</h4> <h5>Nitric Oxide Production and Vasodilation</h5> <ul> <li> <strong>Mechanism of Action: </strong> L-Arginine is converted into nitric oxide in the body, which relaxes blood vessels and improves circulation. </li> <li> <strong>Impact on Erectile Dysfunction: </strong> A meta-analysis in the Journal of Sexual Medicine indicated that L-Arginine supplementation could significantly improve erectile function in men with mild to moderate erectile dysfunction. </li> </ul> <h5>Enhancing Female Sexual Arousal</h5> <ul> <li> <strong>Increased Sensitivity: </strong> Improved blood flow may enhance genital tissue sensitivity, contributing to increased arousal and satisfaction. </li> </ul> <h4>Panax Ginseng: The Ancient Performance Booster</h4> <h5>Ginsenosides and Sexual Function</h5> <ul> <li> <strong>Active Compounds: </strong> Ginsenosides in ginseng are believed to influence the central nervous system and gonadal tissues, enhancing sexual behavior. </li> <li> <strong>Clinical Evidence: </strong> A systematic review in Systematic Biology reported that ginseng significantly improved erectile function compared to placebo. </li> </ul> <h5>Improving Sperm Quality and Libido</h5> <ul> <li> <strong>Fertility Support: </strong> Studies suggest ginseng may enhance sperm count and motility. </li> <li> <strong>Libido Enhancement: </strong> Ginseng has been associated with increased sexual desire in both men and women. </li> </ul> <h4>Guarana Extract: Energizing Intimacy</h4> <h5>Cognitive and Physical Stimulation</h5> <ul> <li> <strong>Natural Caffeine Source: </strong> Guarana contains guaranine, chemically identical to caffeine, which can enhance alertness and reduce fatigue. </li> <li> <strong>Impact on Mood: </strong> A study in Psychopharmacology showed that guarana improved cognitive performance and mood, which can positively influence sexual experiences. </li> </ul> <h5>Traditional Aphrodisiac Use</h5> <ul> <li> <strong>Cultural Practices: </strong> Indigenous tribes in the Amazon have used guarana for its energizing and aphrodisiac properties for centuries. </li> </ul> <h4>Taurine: Supporting Focus and Energy</h4> <h5>Neuroprotective and Stress-Reducing Effects</h5> <ul> <li> <strong>Anxiety Reduction: </strong> Taurine may modulate GABA receptors, promoting calming effects on the nervous system. </li> <li> <strong>Enhancing Concentration: </strong> Improved focus can lead to more mindful and connected intimate experiences. </li> </ul> <h5>Physical Performance</h5> <ul> <li> <strong>Muscle Function Support: </strong> Taurine helps regulate electrolyte balance and muscle contractions, potentially enhancing endurance. </li> </ul> <h3>Synergistic Effects of Combined Ingredients</h3> <h4>Holistic Enhancement of Sexual Health</h4> <ul> <li> <strong>Complementary Actions: </strong> The combination of these ingredients targets various aspects of sexual function—physical, hormonal, and psychological. </li> <li> <strong>Enhanced Efficacy: </strong> A study in Advances in Therapy found that multi-ingredient supplements could have a more significant impact on sexual function than single components. </li> </ul> <h4>Safety and Tolerability</h4> <ul> <li> <strong>Natural Ingredients: </strong> The use of natural, plant-based compounds reduces the risk of adverse side effects. </li> <li> <strong>Clinical Observations: </strong> Studies generally report good tolerability for these ingredients at recommended dosages. </li> </ul>"
